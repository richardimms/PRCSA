NOTE: We will not use Tomcat. This document is just staying here incase we need it.






When trying to run the server in Netbeans there is an error. The following will fix it.

If you have not installed Tomcat in Netbeans then do the following.

1. Download Tomcat version 8. The first zip option under Core. This is what is used on Nigels server.

2. Unzip it anywhere you like.

3. In netbeans on the menu bar select Tools > Servers  then add a new server 
   and direct the path to the location of the unzipped folder.

Once Tomcat is installed the to make it able to run do the following: 

1. Open up the bin folder and then edit the catalina.bat file using Notepad++ or something.

2. Find the following lines and remove the quotes from the two lines and then save:


BEFORE:

:noJuliConfig
set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_CONFIG%"

..

:noJuliManager
set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_MANAGER%"


AFTER:

:noJuliConfig
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_CONFIG%

.. 

:noJuliManager
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_MANAGER%

3. It should work now.
